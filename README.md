This repository contains the tasks that I completed while working as an intern for [The Sparks Foundation.](https://www.thesparksfoundationsingapore.org/)
- **Internship Category** - Data Science and Business Analytics
- **Internship Duration** - 1 Month ( April-2023 )
- **Internship Type** - Work from Home

During the internship, I was assigned 8 tasks. I am pleased to report that I managed to complete 2 of these tasks within the designated timeframe.

### # Task-1: Prediction using Supervised ML (Level - Beginner)
_Click right-side images to view my solution._

1. Predict the percentage of marks of a student based on the number of study hours.
2. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.
3. Data can be found at [http://bit.ly/w-data](http://bit.ly/w-data)
4. You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner, or any other tool.
5. What will be the predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

### # Task-6 : Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm(Level - Intermediate)
_Click right-side images to view my solution._

1. For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.
2. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.

### # Task-3 : Exploratory Data Analysis - Retail (Level - Beginner)
_Click right-side images to view my solution._

1.Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on the provided dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’
2.As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit.
3.What all business problems you can derive by exploring the data?
4.You can choose any of the tool of your choice (Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel)
5.Dataset link :https://bit.ly/3i4rbWl
6.Create storyboards. Screen record along with your audio explaining the charts and interpretations.




All of the tasks can be viewed on my [YouTube playlist.](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLH_YRIN6qskX51sNAyn5StJhuvS-aORNU) as well.
